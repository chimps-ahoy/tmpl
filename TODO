# MAIN GOALS:

- Make working directory stuff clearer (where everything is found and ran is
unclear; makes plugins kinda confusing)

- Allow a _little_ more configuration (maybe i dont want .zs and i dont want to
recompile to change that? maybe .zs isn't the best example, but i want to be
able to layout my directory the way _i_ want, not the way this program expects)

- Maybe make the YAML a bit better (lists, etc)

- Support semantic stuff better (<del> and <ins>, <nav>?)

# THINGS WE __DON'T WANT TO DO__:

- Make the build more complicated
  - __NO CONDITIONALS, IF-ELSE, LOOPS, FUNCTIONS, ANY PROGRAMMABILITY IN THE
    MARKDOWN ETC__
    - except plugins ofc

- _add_ more features*
   - *i think

- make it more complicated
